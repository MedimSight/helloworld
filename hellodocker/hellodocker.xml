                This fields define the user interface that will be used to select the data that your 
                algorithm will receive as input and the outputs that will generate.
            -->
           <in type="volume_group" value="" class="all">
                <name>My Image</name>
				<id>imageone</id>
           </in>
           <!--
                The <in> tag is for inputs. In the type field specify what kind of interface will 
                be used. Example: integer, string, group, etc. In this one, volume_group means
                that the user will be able to select an image from a patient from a group or just
                a group and automatically the app will run over all the patients that have the desired
                image.
                The class field tells us the image that fits better your app, in this example should 
                be a MRI, T1 weighted and that contains a BRAIN.
                The <name> is what the user will see for this field.
                The <id> tag is really important, this value will be used in the python script to
                get the input data using the gsutil library.
            -->
            <out type="string" value="stdfile" class="txt">
              <name>Report name</name>
              <id>txtreport</id>
              <default>Something nice</default>
           </out>
           <out type="string" value="stdfile" class="csv">
              <name>CSV name</name>
              <id>csvreport</id>
              <default>Something nicer</default>
           </out>
            <!--
                The <out> tag is for outputs. In the type field specify what kind of interface will 
                be used. Example: integer, string, group, etc. In this example is a string that 
                will be used to name an image. To know that, we use value=volume.
                The class field tells us the image, if is an image, that your app will return, in this 
                example should be a CT of the BRAIN (looks crazy isn´t it? don´t limit your imagination).
                The <name> is what the user will see for this field.
                The <default> will appear in preset.
                The <id> tag is really important, this value will be used in the python script to
                set the data using the gsutil library.
